# Change Log

## Unreleased

## 4.1.0

### Added

- Generate all 124 standard messages, 1,406 fields, and 200 profile types from
  the exactly pinned Garmin FIT SDK 21.208.0 profile.
- Retain every recognized message in file order under the typed
  `ParsedFit.messages` index without changing existing list, cascade, or
  singleton outputs.
- Decode Garmin strength-training `set` messages in list and cascade modes.
- Add reproducible generated-profile and privacy-safe external corpus audits,
  and enforce profile freshness and coverage in CI.

### Fixed

- Decode fields from their wire base types, including compatible developer
  enum/uint8/byte definitions and correctly sized numeric arrays.
- Reconstruct compressed timestamps and keep timestamp state isolated between
  parser instances.
- Accept omitted header CRCs, validate file CRCs across the complete FIT header
  and data section, and report strict header and file CRC failures explicitly.
- Reject structurally unsafe FIT inputs consistently in callback and Promise
  APIs while retaining force-mode recovery for CRC corruption.
- Correct Garmin profile mappings for OHR settings, monitoring HR, sleep,
  time-in-zone, altitude offsets, and lap/segment flow and grit summaries.
- Correct Celsius-to-Kelvin conversion, add `celsius` as the canonical
  temperature unit, and retain `°C` as a supported alias.

### Compatibility and documentation

- Preserve compatible legacy field names, scales, value shapes, parser
  signatures, output modes, and date behavior while adding canonical profile
  names.
- Add regression coverage for temperature, pressure, validation, compressed
  timestamps, generated profile messages, repeated messages, and MTB
  flow/grit data.
- Refresh the README with current runtime, API, units, output modes, developer
  fields, encoder behavior, and repository commands.

## 4.0.2

- Preserve record alignment when developer-field descriptions are missing or
  appear after their message definitions.
- Decode subsequent developer-field values once their descriptions become
  available, in both strict and force modes.

## 4.0.0

### FIT decoder performance

- Parse `ArrayBuffer` inputs and exact Node.js `Buffer` views directly, avoiding a full copy of the source file.
- Reuse one parse-local `DataView` instead of allocating temporary views for each supported endian field.
- Cache standard field metadata and enum/mask lookups on reusable message definitions.
- Reuse raw field storage for records that share a local message definition.
- Generate elapsed and timer fields once per record instead of once per decoded field.
- Skip header and file CRC scans in `force: true` mode, where CRC mismatches are intentionally ignored; strict mode continues to validate both CRCs.
- Preserve legacy malformed-field zero-padding, field-boundary, developer-field, invalid-value, and offset-buffer behavior.

### Measured benefit

- Suunto 93-hour / 7.5 MB FIT decoding: 1.057 s to 0.375 s, a 64.5% reduction.
- Garmin 110-hour / 28.6 MB FIT decoding: 3.643 s to 1.241 s, a 65.9% reduction.
- Input-related array-buffer memory is approximately halved by removing the full source copy:
  - Suunto: 15.0 MB to 7.5 MB.
  - Garmin: 57.2 MB to 28.6 MB.

There are no intentional parsed-output or public API changes in this release. Output parity was verified across 162 checked-in fixture/mode combinations, 8,320 generated malformed endian-definition cases, and both private long-duration benchmark files.

## 3.1.0

- Add the public `FitEncoder` API for writing FIT headers, definitions, data messages, and CRCs.
- Preserve the `course.sub_sport` field while parsing FIT course files.
